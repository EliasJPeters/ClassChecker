YOU MUST HAVE THE FIREFOX BROWSER

If you do not have Firefox, the program will not work!

For USF Students. Attempts to register for any CRN given. This is useful for classes that have no waitlist.
Users are to input their USF Email, Password, and CRN of the class they would like to register for. 

The program works while both the console window and the browser window is minimized. 
If either are exited, the program will cease to work.

For those worried about the security of their credentials, no information is ever stored in the program or on the host's computer. Everything input to the program is immediately forgotten when the program is closed.
